#### I'm a professional android developer, this is my portfolio.
#### All projects in this repository are personal, and completely unrelated to my professional work.

### I'm currently learning more about:
 - New **Android** tech, specifically **flow & compose**.
 - **React**
 - **Ethereum** blockchain development using **Solidity, hardhat, ethers, and chai**.

## Acknowledgment
I ask that you please acknowledge my work by adding the following lines (or something similar) at the top files with significant amounts of copied or derived code:

```bash
/**************************************************************
 ***  Originally written by https://github.com/broliver12/  ***

```
 
If you copy something small (EG. system method usage) no need for credit.

### Thanks, and as always, Happy Hacking!
