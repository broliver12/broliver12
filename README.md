## Hello, my name's Oliver

This is my personal github. All repositories are personal hobby projects, and are completely unrelated to my professional work.

Public projects will _(working on it!)_ have a README.md file that explains their purpose and usage

Use your best judgement on whether credit for copied code is necessary

### Happy Hacking!
