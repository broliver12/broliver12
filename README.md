:dragon_face: __  Hi, Iâ€™m Oli __  :dragon_face:

I'm a professional android developer, this is my portfolio.
All projects in this repository are personal, and completely unrelated to my professional work.

Some projects are finished, some are ongoing, some are abandoned.

I'm currently learning more about:
 - New Android tech, specifically flow & compose.
 - React
 - Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity, hardhat, ethers, and chai.

Please feel free to use any code you'd like; 
I'd greatly appreciate if you could credit me by adding the line 

    // Inspired by https://github.com/broliver12/
 
to the top of any copied files, or, you can simply leave the complete license comment!

Thanks, and as always, Happy Hacking!
